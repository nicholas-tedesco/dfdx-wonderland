## Differentiable Wonderland: Problem Set

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland](https://www.sscardapane.it/alice-book/) by Simone Scardapane. Topics covered include basic neural network theory, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer models, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
